I did this for my HS project and the code is kind of messy might rework later

It has basic blackjack rules but their is no splitting or surrendering or anything fancy.

This is great for begginers who want to learn how to play blackjack through first hand experiences as it calculates the probability thought bruteforcing and recursion
